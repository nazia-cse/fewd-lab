Build a linear regression model using Python and scikit-learn.


Data Preparation
•       Loading a housing dataset (California housing prices)

•       Handling missing values

•       Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization

Data Visualization
•       Histograms and scatter plots

•       Boxplots to analyze outliers

Building a Linear Regression Model
•       Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

•       Training the model using scikit-learn’s LinearRegression

•       Evaluating model coefficients (slope and intercept)

Model Performance Evaluation
•       Calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

•       Using R² score to assess model fit

Outlier Handling and Improved Model
•       Removing outliers from income and housing values

•       Rebuilding the regression model

•       Comparing performance before and after handling outliers










cc assignment 3:

Create EBS vol and mount it to the EC2 within same region
 1. Attach and detach vol
2. Mount vol
3. Effect of rebooting the instance
Create EBS vol. and mount it to the EC2 across the region
1. Create snapshot
2. Get vols from snapshot attach the vol to instance
Not: provide screenshot for above steps
